# Frankentar

Frankentar is a modified version of the tar format, originally created for use in the Purpl game engine. For more details on the structure of the format, see the file `include/frankentar.h`. This repository also includes a library for parsing and manipulating Frankentar archives to serve as a reference to any interested in reimplementing the format or just using it in their project.
